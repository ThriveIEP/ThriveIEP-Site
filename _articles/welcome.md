We are so proud to have received the Audience Choice Award at this week's CIC (Cambridge Innovation Center)'s Social Impact Program: Growth Stage Cohort event at Venture Café Cambridge! So many of you told us how much our ThriveIEP mission hits home. We are beyond excited to be building an experience that will help parents advocate for their children - with confidence in their understanding and rights, a simplified translation of what they need to know and do at each stage, and a community to support them. Parents don’t have to go it alone!
