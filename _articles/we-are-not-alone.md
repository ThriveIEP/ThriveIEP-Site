This is my second time around with the special education system. I know so much more. It’s a different kid with a different profile. I’m a different advocate.

Walking up the street to the school for our meeting to decide if my child is eligible for special education, my stomach clenches. Tears well up behind my eyes. I desperately want to turn around, go home, and hide under my blankets.

I look at my spouse and ask how he’s doing. He’s carrying the same anxiety. Will they see our child the way we do? Will we have to fight—again—for the support they deserve? This isn’t just a parent teacher conference. It’s a high stakes negotiation. And that means we’re on high alert.

At least we know what we’re getting into?

We’ve got the scars to prove it, and we have a network, knowledge, and skills we didn’t have seven years ago.

This.

This is why we started ThriveIEP. Because this process is so hard and emotional and essential.

We’re not alone. Over 7.5 million kids each year are part of the special education system in the US. And each child has a parent or guardian or other adult who is their advocate. Who is desperately searching for information and support.

Together, we can build a new future. Where anxiety simply means that you are doing something that matters - instead of a signal that you’re flying blind.
