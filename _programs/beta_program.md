<h3>
    Who is a good fit?
</h3>
<p>
    We are looking for parents who have experience with IEPs.
    Below are some questions you might consider if you would like
    to be part of this stage of our IEP journey.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Have a current IEP.
    </li>
    <li>
        Have a child in a public school.
    </li>
    <li>
        Have researched or used a third-party education advocate or lawyer?
    </li>
    <li>
        Have concerns about how well you are using the information in the IEP or
        Neuropsych report.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>
    What to expect?
</h3>

<p>
    Questions. We will have questions! We know that every child is
    unique and every parent's experience is different. We want to understand
    stress points, challenges and solutions.
</p>

<p>
    We will ask for Zoom meetings, feedback and as our Ai tools
    reach pre-release state, you will be asked to share your IEP reports.

        <p>
            The capacity of our beta program is limited. We are a startup so
            will be admitting people as our product evolves. Please be patient
            with us.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will add slots as we scale up.

            We treat your feedback and your child's IEPs with the same
            sensitivity that your doctor handles your medical data, as HIPAA
            data. Expect to be asked for consent. Expect to have us protect
            your data, and expect to have control of how and when it is used.

        <p>
            We will be sending out screening surveys by the middle of August. These
            surveys will help us build a programmatic understanding of your current
            state, your child and your experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will include you in our beta program newsletter and will share
            a timeline of feedback points.
